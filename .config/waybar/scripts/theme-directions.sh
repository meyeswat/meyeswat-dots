echo This config uses pywal16 to grab the colors from a selected wallpaper for system theming.
sleep 1
echo After configuring the wallpaper [using waypaper, accessed via CLI or sidebar shortcut], direct pywal16 to the desired image file by using "wal -i /path/to/img/file".
echo Only one image file can be used at a time for theming.
echo Creating a dedicated directory for wallpaper images is recommended, as well as renaming the files into something legible.

echo To use all 16 colors, add "--cols16" to the end of the command [i.e. wal -i /path/to/img/file --cols16].
echo To create a light color sceme, add "-l".
echo Use "wal -h" for additional help.
